# Getting-started-with-Python-2


This is my second python program, Greedy Snake, a game created with Pygame. 


It took me several days to read materials to adapt to the GUI programming and figure out how to start with a new library. But luckily, a month after, I picked up the work and the code turned out to be not so difficult.


I have to admit that it felt so good that one can whole-heartedly spend one day and a half on one project!


Last but not the least, my bf's detailed explanation on one of my questions offered me a further knowledge on python. Thanks for his patience and Mummy's push. Nothing but appreciation!
