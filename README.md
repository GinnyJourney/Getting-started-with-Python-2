# Getting-started-with-Python-2


## Perface


This is my second python program, Greedy Snake, a game created with Pygame. 


It took me several days to read materials to adapt to the GUI programming and figure out how to start with a new library. But luckily, a month after, I picked up the work and the code turned out to be not so difficult.


I have to admit that it felt so good that one can whole-heartedly spend one day and a half on one project!


Last but not the least, my bf's detailed explanation on one of my questions offered me a further knowledge on python. Thanks for his patience and Mummy's push. Nothing but appreciation!


## Note

The Greedy Snake is a classic game.

In this version, users can start or quit the game by pressing ENTER or ESC on the keyboard, and change snake's direction through UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT ARROW on the keyboard.
